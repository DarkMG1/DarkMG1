# Hiya ðŸ‘‹! ![Visits Badge](https://badges.pufler.dev/visits/DarkMG1/DarkMG1)

### Who the hell am I?
 - I'm a dude who's mainly worked with Java and Javascript, with some Golang (Just for fun)
 - I mainly do Minecraft Plugin Development and Systems Administration
 - On a side note, I was going to start a services company called Dark Services, but school said no.


### What am I working on right now?
 - I'm just doing some plugin freelancing at the moment.
 - I take up a plugin based not on the pay, I accept it if its fun to code or not
 - I do systems administration for multiple servers at the moment, like SurrealCraft, WarfareMC, GhostedMC, and on.
 
**Can I hire you?**
 - For Systems Administration, yes.
 - I'll take plugin requests if they are either easy to make, or they are fun to make.
 - You might get lucky, and I won't even charge you for the plugin.
